# climate-visuals
Latest versions of open access climate visuals by [Ed Hawkins](http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~ed/home/index.php).

These graphics show different aspects of how the climate is changing and are all free to use, with an acknowledgement to Prof. Ed Hawkins (University of Reading) or @ed_hawkins (Twitter) or @climatehawkins (Instagram).

They will be updated as new data becomes available.
